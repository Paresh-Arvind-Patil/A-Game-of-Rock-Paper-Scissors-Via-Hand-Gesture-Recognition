# A-Game-of-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Via-Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Implemented a hand gesture recognition algorithm. Initially, the skin was segmented to separate it from the
background. Then, using the Canny algorithm detected the contours and applied polygon formation with apex
contour vertices, to create a convex hull determining defects and cavities, which is used to understand the gesture
of the hand.
